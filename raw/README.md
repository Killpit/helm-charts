A raw chart to deploy loose kubernetes resources.
Cloned from archived https://github.com/helm/charts repo

**Homepage:** <https://github.com/MinaFoundation/helm-charts>

## Prerequisites

Before using this Helm chart, you should have the following prerequisites:

- Access to Kubernetes cluster (If needed contact your friendly neighbourhood DevOps engineer)
- Helm >= v3.14.3
- (**Optional**) helmfile >= v0.162.0 to install this chart

## Installation

> Note: **examples** can be found in the repository

To install this Helm chart, the easiest is to create a helmfile.yaml with needed values and run:

```
helmfile status
```
